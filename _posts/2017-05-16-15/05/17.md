Hey ZXOscar here,

Today in IT we carried on our Python coding in Code Academy. I enjoy Code Academy as it is something different to the FUZE Box. This is very hard as we only have one hint to help us out. We have to use the skills we build up to complete the harder tasks. Code Academy is very hard but I enjoy it. I really like the badge aspect as it is something to look forward to every time you complete a section. My badges have been little and often really. I haven't had a lot of time on Code Academy so was happy with my progess. I have so far collected 13 Badges.
