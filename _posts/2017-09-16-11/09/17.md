Hey ZXOscar here,

Today we started our brand new year in IT with Google Sheets. Google Sheets is Excel but for Google.We have learnt basic tips and have started Stock. Stock is a basic term used in Sales and Banking. I didn't understand it very much but I'm sure I will over the next couple of weeks. I am enjoying IT at the moment.
