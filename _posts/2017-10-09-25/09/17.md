Hey ZXOscar here, 

So today in It we made a discount code and attempted applying this discount towards the order. For this you will make a new sheet call Discount Codes. From here you make a table containing all of the codes that we could use. So you have 5 codes for 100%, 5 codes for 20% and 5 codes for 25%. Then you apply this cell using Vlookup onto the final order. I did not complete this task because i found it extremely tricky, therefore I am behind.
