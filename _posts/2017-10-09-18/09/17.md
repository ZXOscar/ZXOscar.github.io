Hey ZXOscar here,

So in It we made our stock list and order form. The stock list consists of a table with the item code, item, quantity in stock, buying price and selling price. This table tells us what we have and how much we bought it for and how much we are selling it for. The order form is somebody making an order from the shop and then from there this sheet tells us the amount of money it is plus delivery, VAT etc.
